Hopefully, an easy to use converter for OpenSim OAR files into objects. We need your help and feedback for that. Please use the WIKI, and Issue lists.

Convert OpenSim OAR backup files into the JSON Model format of ThreeJS:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/JSON-Model-format-3.1

There is an example OBJ to JSON python script here:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/utils/converters/obj/convert_obj_three.py

This format can then exported into many more formats like STL, OBJ, Collada, WebGL etc. It would be compatible with these utilities:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils/converters

This can be used to integrate into a web based viewer and exporter. It will start as a test in this project, but then spun off.

We would unpack the OAR file and then do the conversion.
