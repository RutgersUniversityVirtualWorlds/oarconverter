oar2scad
====

The idea was to convert OAR files into an OpenScad Framework. However, OpenScad doesn't have enogh features to represent the objects from an OpenSIM OAR file.

This project will be reformulated as a generic web based OAR converter that uses the ThreeJS library for rendering and export.
